#+TITLE: AmbientCSS Launch Checklist
#+AUTHOR: Claude Code Analysis
#+DATE: 2026-02-15
#+STARTUP: overview
#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS BLOCKED | DONE CANCELLED

* Overview
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2026-02-15]
  :UPDATED:  [2026-02-15]
  :END:

** Current Status
   Initial assessment: ~80% ready for launch
   *REVISED after Codex findings: ~70% ready* - Critical technical blockers found

** Launch Verdict
   - Concept & demo: Launch-ready and impressive ✅
   - Technical implementation: Has critical bugs that MUST be fixed ❌
   - OSS hygiene: Missing essentials (LICENSE, tests, CI) ⚠️

** Target Platforms
   HackerNews, Reddit, LinkedIn, X (Twitter)

** Critical Path
   1-2 weeks to production-ready launch (if focused on CRITICAL tasks only)

** Important Note
   This file incorporates findings from both Claude and Codex analyses.
   Codex identified specific technical blockers through actual build testing.
   See also: launch-todo-codex.org for Codex's original assessment.

* CRITICAL [#A] - Must Complete Before Launch (Week 1)
  DEADLINE: <2026-02-22>

  These are BLOCKERS. Launch will fail without them.

** TODO [#A] Fix TypeScript errors in demo app
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   30min
   :END:

   Current blocker: ~pnpm typecheck~ fails with 8+ errors.

   Files with errors:
   - examples/demo/src/App.tsx:315, 318, 358, 386, 416, 443, 480, 550

   Issue: RefObject<HTMLElement | null> vs RefObject<HTMLElement> type mismatch

   - [ ] Fix ScrollButton component typing
   - [ ] Update ref types to handle null properly
   - [ ] Verify ~pnpm typecheck~ passes clean
   - [ ] Add typecheck to CI gate

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   # Test fix:
   pnpm typecheck
   #+END_SRC

** TODO [#A] Add keyboard accessibility to slider components
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2-3h
   :END:

   CRITICAL A11Y BUG: Components use role="slider" but have NO keyboard support.

   Affected components:
   - packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientKnob.tsx:50
   - packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientSlider.tsx:54
   - packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientFader.tsx:54

   Current state:
   - ✅ role="slider" present
   - ✅ ARIA attributes set
   - ❌ NO tabIndex (can't focus)
   - ❌ NO keyboard handlers

   Required for ARIA compliance:
   - [ ] Add tabIndex={0} to make focusable
   - [ ] Add onKeyDown handler
   - [ ] Implement Arrow Up/Right (increase)
   - [ ] Implement Arrow Down/Left (decrease)
   - [ ] Implement Home (min value)
   - [ ] Implement End (max value)
   - [ ] Optional: PageUp/PageDown (large steps)
   - [ ] Add focus visible styles
   - [ ] Test with screen reader
   - [ ] Document keyboard shortcuts

** TODO [#A] Fix AmbientProvider global side effects
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2h
   :END:

   ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE: Provider mutates document.documentElement globally.

   File: packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientProvider.tsx:33

   Problems:
   - Mutates global scope (document.documentElement.style)
   - Multiple providers will clobber each other
   - Cleanup removes properties globally
   - Not isolated/scoped

   Solutions (choose one):
   - [ ] Option A: Scope CSS vars to provider's div element (preferred)
   - [ ] Option B: Document global behavior + constraints clearly
   - [ ] Option C: Use data attributes or classes instead

   Acceptance:
   - [ ] Multiple providers don't interfere
   - [ ] Theme changes are scoped correctly
   - [ ] Add test for multiple providers
   - [ ] Update docs with behavior notes

** TODO [#A] Fix docs build warnings/errors
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   1h
   :END:

   Current issues:
   - CSS minifier warning at ambient.css:50 (clamp expression)
   - Missing @mdx-js/react error in docs build

   - [ ] Fix CSS expression that causes minifier warning
   - [ ] Ensure ~pnpm docs:build~ completes clean
   - [ ] Test production build output
   - [ ] Verify no console errors in built docs

** TODO [#A] Publish packages to npm
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   2h
   :END:

   Currently returns 404 on npm registry.

   - [ ] Create npm account (if needed)
   - [ ] Add npm credentials to CI/CD
   - [ ] Test publish to npm with --dry-run
   - [ ] Publish @ambientcss/css@1.0.0
   - [ ] Publish @ambientcss/components@1.0.0
   - [ ] Verify packages install correctly: ~pnpm add @ambientcss/css~
   - [ ] Test in fresh project

   Resources:
   - https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-publish
   - Check package.json "files" array includes dist/

** TODO [#A] Add LICENSE file to repository root
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   15min
   :END:

   Package.json says MIT but no LICENSE file exists.

   - [ ] Create LICENSE file with MIT license
   - [ ] Add copyright holder name and year (2026)
   - [ ] Verify it's in git root, not just packages/

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   # Quick command:
   npx license mit > LICENSE
   #+END_SRC

** TODO [#A] Document browser compatibility
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   1-2h
   :END:

   Uses modern CSS features that don't work in older browsers:
   - @property (Chrome 85+, Safari 15.4+, Firefox recent)
   - color-mix() (Chrome 111+, Safari 16.2+, Firefox 113+)

   - [ ] Add "Browser Support" section to main README.md
   - [ ] Add browser compatibility page to docs
   - [ ] List minimum browser versions
   - [ ] Add note about no IE11 support
   - [ ] Optional: Link to caniuse.com for features used

   - /workspace/ambientcss/apps/docs/docs/intro.md
   - New file: apps/docs/docs/guide/browser-support.md

** TODO [#A] Write basic test suite
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   4-6h
   :END:

   Zero tests currently. HN will roast you for this.

   - [ ] Set up test framework (Vitest recommended for Vite projects)
   - [ ] Add @testing-library/react
   - [ ] Write component rendering tests (10-15 tests minimum):
     - [ ] AmbientButton renders
     - [ ] AmbientKnob accepts value prop
     - [ ] AmbientSlider onChange fires
     - [ ] AmbientSwitch toggles
     - [ ] AmbientProvider passes theme to children
     - [ ] AmbientFader works
     - [ ] AmbientPanel renders children
   - [ ] Add test npm scripts to package.json
   - [ ] Document testing in README
   - [ ] Optional: Add coverage reporting

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   # Install deps:
   pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom
   #+END_SRC

** TODO [#A] Version strategy decision
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT:   15min
   :END:

   Currently at 0.1.0 which signals "not ready"

   Choose ONE:
   - [ ] Bump to 1.0.0 (signals production-ready, confident)
   - [ ] Stay at 0.x.x and label as "beta" in docs (honest about maturity)

   If bumping to 1.0.0:
   - [ ] Update all package.json versions
   - [ ] Add note in docs about stability commitment
   - [ ] Ensure breaking changes will follow semver

   My recommendation: 1.0.0 if you complete all critical tasks

* IMPORTANT [#B] - Strongly Recommended (Week 2)

* Key Findings from Codex Analysis

  Codex identified critical issues through actual build/test execution that
  were missed in the initial code review:

** Technical Blockers Found
   1. ❌ TypeScript errors (8+ failures in demo app)
   2. ❌ Missing keyboard accessibility (ARIA violation)
   3. ❌ Global side effects in AmbientProvider (architectural issue)
   4. ⚠️ Build warnings in docs CSS

** What This Teaches Us
   - Static code review alone is insufficient
   - Always run: build, typecheck, and test commands
   - Accessibility requires actual ARIA compliance testing
   - Architectural issues matter (global mutations)

** Combined Assessment
   This merged TODO combines:
   - Claude's high-level product/market readiness analysis
   - Codex's specific technical bug identification
   - Together: Complete launch readiness checklist

* Notes

** Estimated Timeline
   - Critical tasks: 8-12 hours of focused work
   - Important tasks: 15-20 hours
   - Optional tasks: 15+ hours

   Realistic timeline: 1-2 weeks working part-time

** Key Success Metrics
   - npm downloads in first week
   - GitHub stars
   - HN upvotes and discussion quality
   - Community PRs/issues
   - Social media engagement

** Potential Risks
   - Browser compatibility criticism
   - "Too niche" feedback
   - Bundle size concerns
   - Performance on low-end devices

   Be prepared with responses to these.

* After Launch

** TODO Post-launch tasks
   - [ ] Write retrospective blog post
   - [ ] Thank contributors
   - [ ] Plan v1.1 based on feedback
   - [ ] Set up issue triage process
   - [ ] Consider Discord/community channel
   - [ ] Regular maintenance schedule
