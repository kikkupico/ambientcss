#+TITLE: ambientcss Launch TODO (Codex)
#+AUTHOR: Codex
#+DATE: 2026-02-15

* Launch Verdict
- Current status: *Not ready for broad public launch yet*.
- Practical status: showcase-ready, not internet stress-test ready.

* Blockers
** DONE Fix workspace typecheck failures
- Files:
  - ~examples/demo/src/App.tsx:201~
  - ~examples/demo/src/App.tsx:223~
  - ~examples/demo/src/App.tsx:315~ (and related ref typing errors onward)
- Acceptance criteria:
  - ~pnpm typecheck~ passes at workspace root.
  - Clean clone + install + typecheck is green.

** DONE Add keyboard accessibility for interactive controls
- Files:
  - ~packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientSlider.tsx:54~
  - ~packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientFader.tsx:54~
  - ~packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientKnob.tsx:50~
- Issue:
  - Components use ~role="slider"~ but lack keyboard behavior and proper focus handling.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Add ~tabIndex~ where needed.
  - Implement keyboard handlers: Arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown (optional), Home/End.
  - Verify ARIA states stay in sync with value.

** DONE Remove/contain global side effects from AmbientProvider
- File:
  - ~packages/ambient-components/src/components/AmbientProvider.tsx:33~
- Issue:
  - Mutates ~document.documentElement~ and removes properties globally on cleanup.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Scope CSS vars to provider container element (preferred), or
  - Clearly document global mutation behavior + constraints.
  - No theme clobbering with multiple providers.

** DONE Resolve docs CSS minifier warning
- File:
  - ~packages/ambient-css/src/ambient.css:50~
- Issue:
  - Docs production build logs lexical/minification warning around ~clamp(...) * 100%~ expression.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - ~pnpm docs:build~ completes without CSS lexical/minifier warnings.

** TODO Add OSS launch hygiene essentials
- Missing now:
  - Repo-level ~LICENSE~ file
  - Test suite coverage for core behaviors
  - CI quality gate for build/typecheck/tests
  - Publish/release automation for npm packages
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Add ~LICENSE~ at repo root.
  - Add at least minimal tests (behavior + a11y smoke).
  - Add CI workflow: install, build, typecheck, tests.
  - Add release workflow (manual or automated) for npm publish.

** TODO Verify npm publishing and install flow end-to-end
- Goal:
  - Ensure packages are actually installable by users at launch time.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Confirm ~@ambientcss/css~ and ~@ambientcss/components~ are published.
  - Validate install from a fresh project (outside monorepo links).
  - Validate docs install commands match real published versions.

** TODO Decide and document versioning strategy
- Issue:
  - Current ~0.1.0~ may signal pre-stable status to launch audiences.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Decide: launch as ~1.0.0~ or explicitly label as beta.
  - Reflect the decision consistently in docs and release notes.

** TODO Document browser compatibility for core CSS features
- Why:
  - The library relies on modern CSS features (~@property~, ~color-mix()~).
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Add browser support section to root ~README.md~.
  - Add browser support details in docs (minimum supported versions).
  - State unsupported environments clearly.

** TODO Add CHANGELOG for release transparency
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Add ~CHANGELOG.md~ at repo root.
  - Include initial release notes and notable capabilities.
  - Keep changelog linked from ~README.md~.

* Suggested Launch Gate
** DONE Define and enforce launch command
- Proposed gate command:
  - ~pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm docs:build~
- Add to CI and require green before announcement posts.
